Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[3] is a team sport played between
 two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 
countries and dependencies making it the world's most popular sport.[4][5][6][7] The game is played
 on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball
 into the opposing goal.
Players are not allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play, unless they are
 goalkeepers (and then only when within their penalty area). Other players mainly use their feet to
 strike or pass the ball, but may also use their head or torso. The team that scores the most goals 
by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared
 or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition.
 The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. 
Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association 
Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale d Football Association), which organises World
 Cups for both men and women every four years.[8]The rules of association football were codified in 
England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name association football was coined to
 distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time, specifically rugby football.
 The first written "reference to the inflated ball used in the game" was in the mid-14th century:
 "Þe heued fro þe body went, Als it were a foteballe".[9] The Online Etymology Dictionary states that
 the word "soccer" was "split off in 1863".[9] According to Partha Mazumdar, the term soccer 
originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an Oxford "-er" abbreviation of the word
 "association".[10]
Within the English-speaking world, association football is now usually called football in the United 
Kingdom and mainly soccer in Canada and the United States. People in Australia, Ireland, South
 Africa and New Zealand use either or both terms, although national associations in Australia and
 New Zealand now primarily use "football" for the formal name.[11]According to FIFA, the Chinese
 competitive game cuju (??, literally "kick ball") is the earliest form of football for which there is
 scientific evidence.[13] Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the
 intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern 
football, though similarities to rugby occurred.[14][15] During the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD)
, cuju games were standardised and rules were established.[14]Phaininda and episkyros were Greek
 ball games.[16][17] An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a vase at the National
 Archaeological Museum of Athens[12] appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup.[18]
 Athenaeus, writing in 228 AD, referenced the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros
 and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby
 football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football.[14][19][20][21]
[22][23] As with pre-codified "mob football", the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three
 games involved more handling the ball than kicking.[24][25] Non-competitive games included
 kemari in Japan, chuk-guk in Korea and woggabaliri in Australia.Association football in itself does
 not have a classical history.[26] Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around
 the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in
 antiquity outside Europe.[27] The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th
 century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of
 England. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century AD.[28]
The Cambridge Rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential
 in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were
 written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow,
 Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s,
 many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking 
world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most
 notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857,[29] which led
 to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also 
devised an influential set of rules.[30]
These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863,
 which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen
 Street, London.[31] The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The 
Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which
 eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer,
 the representative from Blackheath, withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft 
rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for 
obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other
 English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the 
Rugby Football Union. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went
 on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game.[31] These rules included handling of the ball by
 "marks" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules
 football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the
 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.
[32]The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by C. W. Alcock and
 has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also
 took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of 
C. W. Alcock. England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in 
Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor.[33] The original format contained 12
 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.Casual games can be played with only minimal 
equipment – a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball
 and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary
 from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be 
self-officiated by the players.
