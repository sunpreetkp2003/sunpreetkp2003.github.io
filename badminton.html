The game of badminton requires only a few pieces of equipment, and the rules are fairly 
simple, which may be why people have been playing it for 2000 years and an ideal choice 
for all ages.
Battledore and Shuttlecock
The game of badminton is thought to be approximately 2000 years old. Early versions were
 played in China, Greece and India. It strongly resembles a game called Battledore and 
Shuttlecock, which was played by the British upper class in the 17th century.

Badminton Equipment
To play badminton, players will need a net, a shuttlecock, and at least two rackets.

The net crosses the center of the badminton court. It needs to be 5 feet 1 inch high at both
 ends and 5 feet high in the center. The posts must be at the farthest sidelines, 20 feet
 apart, for both singles and doubles play.

Rackets may be made of lots of materials, but modern badminton rackets are usually made 

of a carbon fiber composite. A square head is traditional, but many use an oval head shape
 now. The length must be no more than 680 millimeters and width must be no more than 
230 mm. The head must be no more than 280 mm in length and 220 mm in width.

The shuttlecock (also called a shuttle or a birdie) has a round base, usually made of cork,
covered in a thin layer of leather or other material. Stuck into this are sixteen feathers in
 a traditional shuttle. Most modern shuttles use plastic 'feathers' instead because they are 
less expensive and sturdier.

Rules of the Game
Two or four people can play the game - two for singles, four (in two teams of two) for doubles.
 The players use their rackets to rally the shuttle, or pass the shuttle from side to side over
 the net. If Team A fails to return a rally, that is a point for Team B.

The game is played to 21 points. If the score is tied at 20 points, teams play until one side
 leads by two points (i.e., 21-23). If the score gets tied at 29 points, whoever makes the next
 point wins. A team wins the match when they win two out of three games.

The court is a 44-foot-long rectangle with a net at the midpoint. It should be 20 feet wide for
 doubles and 17 feet wide for singles. In practice, courts tend to be 20 feet wide with an inner
 line marking the sideline for singles. On each half of the court there is a left and right service
 court, a short service line, and a back service line.

Serving
In both singles and doubles, the racket needs to hit the shuttle when the shuttle is lower than
 the server's waist with the head of the racket pointing down. The serve needs to go past the 
opponent's short service line to count.

In singles, players begin by standing in service courts that are diagonal to each other. For the 
first serve, this will be each side's right service court. After that, if the serving player has an
 even number of points, he or she serves from the right service court; if he or she has an odd 
number of points, the left.
