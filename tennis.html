Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.

Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be
 played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis 
originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as "lawn tennis".[1] It had close 
connections both to various field ("lawn") games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older
 racket sport of real tennis. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term "tennis" referred to
 real tennis, not lawn tennis: for example, in Disraeli's novel Sybil (1845), Lord Eugene De Vere 
announces that he will "go down to Hampton Court and play tennis."[2]
The rules of tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961
 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 
1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review 
technology coupled with a point challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a
 point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also
 a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the 
"Majors") are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open 
played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open played also on hard
 courtsGrand Slam tournamentsThe four Grand Slam tournaments are considered to be the most
 prestigious tennis events in the world. They are held annually and comprise, in chronological order
, the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Apart from the Olympic 
Games, Davis Cup, Fed Cup, and Hopman Cup, they are the only tournaments regulated by the
 International Tennis Federation (ITF).[75] The ITF's national associations, Tennis Australia 
(Australian Open), the Fédération Française de Tennis (French Open), the Lawn Tennis Association
 (Wimbledon) and the United States Tennis Association (US Open) are delegated the responsibility to
 organize these events.[75]Aside from the historical significance of these events, they also carry
 larger prize funds than any other tour event and are worth double the number of ranking points to
 the champion than in the next echelon of tournaments, the Masters 1000 (men) and Premier events
 (women).[76][77] Another distinguishing feature is the number of players in the singles draw. There
 are 128, more than any other professional tennis tournament. This draw is composed of 32 
seeded players, other players ranked in the world's top 100, qualifiers, and players who receive 
invitations through wild cards. Grand Slam men's tournaments have best-of-five set matches while
 the women play best-of-three. Grand Slam tournaments are among the small number of events 
that last two weeks, the others being the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Masters.
Currently, the Grand Slam tournaments are the only tour events that have mixed doubles contests.
 Grand Slam tournaments are held in conjunction with wheelchair tennis tournaments and junior 
tennis competitions. These tournaments also contain their own idiosyncrasies. For example, players
 at Wimbledon are required to wear predominantly white. Andre Agassi chose to skip Wimbledon 
from 1988 through 1990 citing the event's traditionalism, particularly its "predominantly white"
 dress code.[78] Wimbledon has its own particular methods for disseminating tickets, often leading 
tennis fans to follow complex procedures to obtain tickets.[79]Grand Slam tournaments
